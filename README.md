**RPS: Battle Royale** isn't your grandma's rock-paper-scissors. It's a hardcore, strategy-based dungeon crawler where every choice matters and sick combos can mean the difference between sweet victory and brutal defeat!

## ⚔️ EPIC FEATURES ⚔️

- **INSANE ENEMY VARIETY**: Face off against 10+ unique enemies including Mimics that copy your moves, Berserkers that get stronger as they take damage, and Shielded foes that can straight-up BLOCK your attacks!

- **KILLER LOOT SYSTEM**: Collect over 20 game-changing items and relics:

  - 💥 **Coup De Grace**: 40% chance to ABSOLUTELY DESTROY enemies with 400% scissors damage!
  - 🛡️ **Absolute Defense**: 50% chance to completely nullify damage when you lose with Paper!
  - 🔥 **Double Dragon**: Double damage with Rock because DOUBLE THE PAIN!
  - 🩸 **Vampire Blade**: Lifesteal with Scissors because why not heal while you're slicing?

- **ROGUELIKE PROGRESSION**: Navigate a unique map each run with multiple paths, tough decisions, and high-risk high-reward scenarios!

- **STRATEGIC DEPTH**: Plan your moves, counter enemy patterns, and build synergistic item combos to CRUSH your opponents!

## 🎮 HOW TO PLAY 🎮

1. **CHOOSE YOUR PATH**: Navigate through nodes on the map. Will you face an elite enemy for better rewards or play it safe?

2. **PLAN YOUR STRATEGY**: Queue up to five moves in advance – predict your enemy or bait them into a trap!

3. **BATTLE IT OUT**: Each round compares your move against the enemy's. Win to deal damage, lose to take damage!

4. **GEAR UP**: After battles, get coins and items to build your ultimate RPS warrior!

5. **FACE THE BOSS**: Reach the end of the map and take down the final boss to claim victory!

## 💪 PRO GAMER TIPS 💪

- Different enemies have different patterns – Mimics copy your previous moves, while Predictors try to counter your most-used action!

- The Shielded enemy has different block chances: 50% vs Rock, 30% vs Scissors, and 20% vs Paper. KNOW YOUR MATCHUPS!

- Balance offense and defense – items like Thornmail can help you win even when you're losing!

- When playing against a Berserker, try to finish them quickly before they get ENRAGED!

- Some items (like Absolute Defense) activate when you LOSE with a specific move, while others (like Coup De Grace) trigger when you WIN. Build your strategy accordingly!
